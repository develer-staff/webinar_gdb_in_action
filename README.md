## gdb commands examples folder

This folder contains very simple programs that can be used to familiarize with the most common commands of GDB. There are also simple txt files containing a list of instructions that should help in familiarizing with some gdb commands.

## gdb debugging session folder

This folder contains the minimal broken program that has been used to create the "semi-live debugging session" of the webinar. It also contains a simple txt script listing all the instructions (with some comments) that can be used to debug the program.
